# Cat Clicker

This is a simple app built with vanilla JavaScript made for practice with the model, view, and octopus (or controller) architectural design pattern.

## How to View

Clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Functionality

This app changes the picture to the one associated with the text (cat name) upon the name click and increments the number listed above the picture with each click on the image.

When the 'Admin' button is clicked, admin panel fields are updated with current information about the displayed cat.

The number of clicks and cat name can be changed from within the admin panel.

If the admin information is in view, the fields are updated when either another cat is clicked or the cat currently displayed is clicked.
